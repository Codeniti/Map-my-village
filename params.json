{"name":"Map-my-village","tagline":"ScreenShots","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n###About App\r\nThis will help to mark the boundaries of remote village which is not exactly available on google map \r\nour app will use gps it will recognize the current lattitude location using android lattitude provide when user hits start tracking key it start calculating  area  by recording the lattitude and longitude  information \r\nwhich is covered by the user and  is updated in databases\r\nour database has information such as: \r\n forest area \r\n village boundary \r\n desert \r\n river bed \r\n barren land \r\n urban areas \r\n rural areas\r\n in databases\r\n\twe are also planning to find nearest popular landmark in google maps\r\nit will avoid   illegal  acquiring of lands in the remote forest area by other persons.\r\nwhich  will help for the people to use it and it will give map validation for their boundary without\r\nthat it is difficult to find.\r\n      Lines of latitude and longitude are used to locate places on earth by using the geographic coordinate system. Latitude is the angle from a point on the earth's surface and the equatorial plane measured from the center of the sphere. Longitude is the angle east or west of a reference meridian between the two geographical poles to another meridian that passes through an arbitrary point. They are used to locate places on earth by telling you where something is vertically and horizontally on the earth.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
